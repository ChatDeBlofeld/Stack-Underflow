# AMT\_Project
## Frontend
Since this project uses [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), you'll need to install it (with it's dependencies) in order to change the styling.
> Note: If you don't want to change the styling you can skip this whole section since a default stylesheet was added to the repo
> 
> The following commands need to be executed at the root of the project.

First install the dependencies:
```
$ npm i
```

You then need to run the following to compile the css:
```sh
# development
$ npm run watch

# production
$ npm run build
```

And voila!
> Note: You need to redeploy the war to the server in order to see changes
